# üö¢ Ship Classification using VGG16 (Flask + Deep Learning)

This project classifies ship images using a convolutional neural network based on **VGG16**. It is developed in two parts:

- üß† A Jupyter Notebook to train the deep learning model  
- üåê A Flask Web App to load the model and classify images

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Flask App

> Prerequisite: Python 3.8+ and the `.h5` model file (downloaded separately)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ship-classification.git
   cd ship-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the model file `best_vgg16_model.h5` from the link below and place it inside the `models/` folder:
   üìÅ [Insert Google Drive link here]

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser at: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
